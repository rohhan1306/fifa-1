            <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international association football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. The 22nd FIFA World Cup, it is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022. This is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the second World Cup held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is currently the most expensive World Cup ever held. France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final.</p>

            <div class="h3">HISTORY</div>
            <p>The FIFA World Cup was first held in 1930, when FIFA, the world's football governing body, decided to stage an international men's football tournament under the era of FIFA president Jules Rimet who put this idea into place. The inaugural edition, held in 1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization. Since then, the World Cup has experienced successive expansions and format remodeling, with its current 32-team final tournament preceded by a two-year qualifying process, involving over 200 teams from around the world.</p>

            <div class="h3">PRESIDENT</div>
            <p>Since his first election in February 2016, Gianni Infantino’s presidency has focused on bringing wide-ranging reforms to FIFA, expanding global participation in FIFA’s flagship competitions and boosting FIFA’s investment in football development through the Forward Programme.Having delivered a successful reform process, the new FIFA has broadened its horizons to take a more active role as a responsible member of global society, whether through the promotion of education and life skills for children under the FIFA Football for Schools Programme, the protection of minors and vulnerable members of the football family with the FIFA Guardians initiative, or by partnering with international organisations – including various agencies of the United Nations, the African Union, ASEAN, and the Council of Europe – to use the unique power of football as a driver of positive social progress.

                Gianni Infantino’s long-term vision for FIFA is to make football truly global by levelling-up playing and organisational standards across every continent and expanding participation in the world’s most prestigious football competitions: the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women’s World Cup.
